# Gamemaster MCP üêâ - Project Roadmap

## 1. üéØ Project Vision & Technical Architecture

### Data Model Relationships

The system is built around a hierarchical data structure with the `Campaign` model at its core. All other models relate to the active campaign through these key relationships:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Campaign] --> B[GameState]
    A --> C[Character]
    A --> D[NPC]
    A --> E[Location]
    A --> F[Quest]

    A --> H[SessionNote]
    B --> I[AdventureEvent]
    
    C --> J[Item]

    C --> M[CharacterClass]
    C --> N[Race]

### Core Concepts: Interplay of Data Models

The Gamemaster MCP server organizes all campaign data around a central `Campaign` model, which acts as the primary container for the entire game world. This design ensures a cohesive and interconnected data structure, allowing the LLM client to easily manage and interact with various game elements.

Here's how the core data models in `src/gamemaster_mcp/models.py` interact and relate:

* **`Campaign`**: The foundational model. It encapsulates all campaign-specific data, including:
    * **`characters`**: A dictionary of `Character` models, representing player characters. Each `Character` is a complex model composed of `CharacterClass`, `Race`, `AbilityScore` (for core stats), `Item` (for inventory and equipment), and `Spell` (for known spells).
    * **`npcs`**: A dictionary of `NPC` models, representing non-player characters. NPCs can be linked to `Location` models.
    * **`locations`**: A dictionary of `Location` models, defining places within the campaign world. Locations can list associated NPCs and connections to other locations.
    * **`quests`**: A dictionary of `Quest` models, tracking ongoing and completed missions. Quests can reference NPCs as givers.
    * **`encounters`**: A dictionary of `CombatEncounter` models, detailing planned or active combat scenarios. Encounters can be tied to specific locations.
    * **`sessions`**: A list of `SessionNote` models, providing summaries and details for each game session played within the campaign.
    * **`game_state`**: A single `GameState` model, which captures the dynamic, real-time conditions of the campaign, such as the current location, active quests, and party funds. This model is crucial for the LLM to understand the immediate context of the game.

* **`GameState`**: While part of the `Campaign`, `GameState` plays a pivotal role in reflecting the current state of the world. It influences and is influenced by other models:
    * `current_location` can point to a `Location` model.
    * `active_quests` references `Quest` titles.
    * Changes in `Character` status (e.g., `hit_points_current`) or `Quest` status (`active`, `completed`) directly impact the `GameState` and how the LLM perceives the campaign.

* **`AdventureEvent`**: This model, along with `EventType`, is used to log significant occurrences throughout the campaign. While not directly nested within `Campaign` (it's stored globally), `AdventureEvent` instances often reference elements from the `Campaign`'s data, such as `characters_involved` and `location`. This provides a historical log that the LLM can use to understand past events and narrative progression.

This interconnected structure allows the LLM client to query, update, and generate content for the campaign by interacting with a unified and logically organized data set. The Pydantic validation ensures data integrity across all operations.

## 2. üåü Current Version (v1.0)

The current version of the server provides a robust foundation for comprehensive campaign management, built on a solid storage layer and a rich set of data models.

### Key Features

* **Architecture**: Modern, type-safe architecture using FastMCP 2.9.0+, with clear separation of concerns between the server logic ([`main.py`](src/gamemaster_mcp/main.py)), data models ([`models.py`](src/gamemaster_mcp/models.py)), and persistence ([`storage.py`](src/gamemaster_mcp/storage.py)).
* **Campaign Management**: Full CRUD operations for creating, loading, and managing multiple, distinct campaigns.
* **Data Persistence**: A reliable storage layer that saves campaign data to JSON files (`dnd_data/campaigns/`) and maintains a global event log (`dnd_data/events/adventure_log.json`).
* **Comprehensive Data Models**: A rich set of Pydantic models covering all core D&D concepts:
    * `Campaign`, `GameState`, `SessionNote`
    * `Character`, `NPC`, `Race`, `CharacterClass`
    * `Location`, `Quest`, `Item`, `Spell`
    * `CombatEncounter`, `AdventureEvent`
* **Core Toolset**: A suite of 25+ tools providing essential functionality for:
    * Campaign, Character, NPC, Location, and Quest management.
    * Game State and Session tracking.
    * Basic Combat and Event logging.
    * Utility functions like dice rolling.

**Goal**: Automate complex game mechanics and create a more dynamic, simulated world that reacts to player actions.

| Feature                          | Description                                                                                                                                                           | Related Tools / Models                                                                                             |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Faction & Reputation System**  | Introduce `Faction` models and tools to track player reputation with various in-game factions. Reputation changes could be triggered by completing quests or events. | `Faction` model, `update_reputation`, `get_faction_standing`                                                       |

### Phase 3: Scalability & Integration (v1.3)

**Goal**: Evolve the server from a standalone tool into a scalable, interconnected hub for a broader D&D ecosystem.

| **API for Third-Party Apps**  | Expose a secure, public API that allows other applications (e.g., character sheet managers, virtual tabletops) to read and write data to the campaign.                  | `OAuth2` integration, `RESTful API` models           |
| **Webhooks & Event Streaming**| Implement a system for pushing real-time updates to other services when key events occur in the campaign (e.g., a character levels up, a quest is completed).          | `Webhook` model, `emit_event` tool                   |
